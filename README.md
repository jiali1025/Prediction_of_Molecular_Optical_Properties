## Dataset

Dataset is composed of molecules with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) or aggregation caused quenching (ACQ) properties reported in the literature. When collecting data, we screened the molecules according to the following criteria: 1) capture representative AIE/ACQ counterparts that show similar molecular structures but opposite AIE/ACQ property; 2) screen molecules derived from the same AIE core, especially the classic cores. To avoid an unbalanced and biased dataset, we restricted the number of molecules derived from the same core. Totally , 356 molecules were collected for model training.
